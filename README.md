# Cashew macOS app

This project started with the abandoned-but-open-sourced Cashew app source code. After spending many days migrating the code through the various Swift versions from Swift 2 to Swift 4 and fixing crashes, now I'd like to build on this base to develop Cashew with my own ideas and priorities in mind. It'll remain open-source, and you're welcome to contribute PRs for fixes, or suggest new features via issues.

### To run app:

1. Download the .dmg file [here](https://github.com/bellebethcooper/cashew/releases/tag/1.10.4)
2. Open the .dmg file you downloaded
3. Open Cashew.app from the contents of the .dmg when it opens

### To compile the source code:

1. Open Xcode 10
2. Open workspace file: Cashew.xcworkspace
3. Run app!

*Note: You might need to turn off code signing for it to run. If you have any other issues, please let me know. I'm not well-versed in sharing the source for my projects, or in macOS development yet.*
