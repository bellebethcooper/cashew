# Cashew macOS app

Recently, we've been getting alot of interest to fix the current version of Cashew on the Mac App Store. And we want you to know that we're very humbled and excited that people love our product üôèüèº However, due to lack of time required to maintain this app, we've decided to open source it! So feel free to send PRs out for bugs fixes, new features or even code refactors. On our side, we'll commit to pushing updates to the Mac App Store every two weeks if enough interest is there. 

### To run app:
1. Install Xcode from Mac App Store
2. Open workspace file: Cashew.xcworkspace
3. Run!

### Want to contribute?
1. Code away
2. Create a PR
3. We'll merge the PR if all looks good!

### What do I need to know?
1. The app is 50/50 Swift and Objective-C
2. All new code preferrably written in Swift but we'll never say no to Objective-C
3. Currently, the project requires an upgrade to Swift 4 in order to even run. We need a volunteer to do that first in order for other folks to contribute.
